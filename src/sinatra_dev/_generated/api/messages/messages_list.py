    """Read the conversation

     Returns the conversation of a task started from the API, CLI, MCP or dashboard, oldest first. A task
    that started elsewhere has no conversation here (`409 not_an_api_task`); its conversation is where
    it started.

    The conversation holds final answers and questions, not progress. Each agent posts one reply: its
    answer, or a question when it needs your input. Sinatra adds its own notices, such as errors and
    refusals.

    Each entry's `role` and `kind` say what it is:

    - `user` and `message`: a message a person sent. `messageId` is its idempotency key, or a generated
    id.
    - `agent` and `response`: the agent's answer.
    - `agent` and `clarify`: a question the agent needs answered to continue.
    - `platform` and `response` or `error`: a message from Sinatra itself, such as a refusal, an error,
    a stop, or files the agent produced.

    When `next` isn't `null`, more entries follow: pass `next` as `after` to get the next page.

    There is no streaming. To wait for a reply, poll this endpoint with `after` set to the `id` of the
    last entry you read, and check the task's `status` with Get a task. The agent has handed back when
    the task stops working, for example when it reaches `replied` or `pr_open`. While a task is waiting
    for a running agent to finish, its conversation stays quiet; its `queued` field says so.

    Args:
        workspace_id (str):
        task_id (str):
        after (str | Unset):
        limit (int | Unset):  Default: 100.

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
